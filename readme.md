# My iOS Develop learning path
So, i'm really excited about becoming an iOS Developer. I bought my Macmini a couple of years ago for this purpose, but never had the chance to start some serious process towards learning it.

I'm following a couple of new people, I will link them all here and really hope they won't mind it.

## Courses
