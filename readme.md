# My iOS Develop learning path
So, I'm really excited about becoming an iOS Developer. I bought my Mac mini a couple of years ago for this purpose but never had the chance to start some serious process towards learning it.

I'm following a couple of new people, I will link them all here and really hope they won't mind it.

## Courses

## Topics

I separated a list of topics pointed out by Brian Voong from [Let's build that App](https://www.letsbuildthatapp.com). Pretty good channel, not only because it has awesome technical content but because he's such an amazing mentor for the whole community.
